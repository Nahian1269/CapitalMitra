# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the project locally

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    After the installation is complete, run this command to start the app:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the development server, and you can view your application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:9002`. Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser.
